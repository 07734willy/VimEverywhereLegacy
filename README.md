# VimEverywhere

VimEverywhere is a Python background process that transparently brings Vim text editing to every application on your computer. It works just like Vim, but without displaying a Vim/gVim window and editing inside. Just start typing, and if you wish to disable Vim keybindings temporarily, switch to a new mode "pass-through mode".
